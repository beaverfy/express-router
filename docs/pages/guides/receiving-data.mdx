# Receiving Data
You may want to receive data from your Wear OS client, to receive data, set up a listener or use the `useWearData()` hook:

## Listen for events
This is basically what [`useWearData()`](#wear-data-hook) does, but without the hook:

```tsx
import { getRNEventName } from "react-native-wear";
DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(getRNEventName(), async (data) => {
  //...
});
```
## Wear Data Hook
Import `useWearData`:
```ts
import { useWearData } from "react-native-wear";
```
Use the hook to receive data:
```tsx
const { data } = useWearData((data) => data.message);
```
