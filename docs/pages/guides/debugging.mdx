# Debugging
<Callout type="warning">
In version `1.0.11` we've removed debugging as it's caused some build issues
</Callout>
Sometimes, you might need to debug your project. You can enable debugging by passing `debugLogs: true`:

```ts
sendDataToClient({
    //...
}, {
    debugLogs: true
});
```
