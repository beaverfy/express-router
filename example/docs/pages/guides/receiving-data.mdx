# Receiving Data
You may want to receive data from your Wear OS client, to receive data, set up a listener or use the `useWearData()` hook:

## Listen for events
```tsx
import { getRNEventName } from "react-native-wear";
DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(getRNEventName(), async (data) => {
  //...
});
```
## Wear Data Hook
`useWearData()` is a hook that [listens for events](#listen-for-events) and uses the function provided to resolve the value:

```tsx
import { useWearData } from "react-native-wear";

const { data } = useWearData((data) => data.message);
```
